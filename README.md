TEST TEXT ANALYSIS:
==================

1. In the html text file, find the number of occurrences (count) for the following phrase "Nike"
and output the count. Make sure to look for pluraly and lowercase versions of the phrase as well as existing anchor elements.

2. Convert the html text file:

a). Covert all "Nike" (including plural, lowercase versions) of the word into links.
The links should be the following format: <a data-test=firstnamelastname>searchterm</a> without changing the text.

For example if you find the phrase "This is nike's great achievement" and your name is Alicia Chan the phrase
will be replaced by: "This is <a data-test=firstnamelastname>nike's</a> great achievement"

b). Do not convert any existing anchor tags.

3. Is the article positive or negative sentiment? 
Please provide reasonings as to how you came up with the solution.  Bonus if you can show code that proves this.


Please commit all your changes once done.
